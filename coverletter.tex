%	LETTER CONTENT
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{Interested Areas}
I am interested in the field of automatic identification, machine learning, distributed computing network and human-computer interaction, especially in the context of Industrie 4.0.
My current research focuses on robust and scalable RFID middleware with environment-adaptive performance optimization, which will be demanded by the upcoming business scenes in Japanese ecosystem along with a national project.
I like to identify a problem in real world and design a mechanism to solve it; so I also am enthusiastic to have collaboration projects with industrial partners.

\lettersection{Motivation, Goal and why ETH?}
My motivation to pursue the PhD degree in Distributed Systems Group and ETH is to foster a strong academic sense in realizing future technology development.
So far I have been more attached to practical deployment and operation of specific appliances.
Then I felt the need to build a academic foundation inside myself to have a wider vision to look ahead in terms of novelty, besides technical difficulties.
I also want to build my career as a scientific researcher by publishing academic papers and contributing to the research community.
After receiving the PhD, I plan to work as a professional engineer with expertise from both industrial and academic point of view.
I am also excited to put myself in the totally different environment from where I have been, with learning the culture in Zurich and German language.

\lettersection{Estimate about possible starting date}
Since I am graduating my Master’s program in March, 2018, starting immediately from April would be the ideal;
however, the possible earliest might be February as my final semester actually ends in the beginning of February and also matches with the start of semester.
